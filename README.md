# COVID-19 Outcomes by Long-Term Care Ownership Type

This repository contains raw data on deaths from COVID-19 in Ontario long-term care homes between January 15-July 14, 2020. The csv file includes the name, number of deaths, and number of beds for each facility that had a COVID-19 outbreak during that time period. It also notes the ownership of each facility: financialized (owned by private equity firm or real estate investment trust), for-profit, municipal, or non-profit.

It also contains code, which can be run using Python. The code calculates and produces a bar chart depicting the death rate by ownership type. Also included in the csv file and code is data on the percentage of long-term care residents over the age of 85, broken down by ownership type.

Long-term care facilities with fewer than five deaths are denoted by “<5” in the publicly available data in order to protect resident privacy. Because the precise number of deaths for each ownership type is unknown, my figure is based on the upper end of the range, but the lower end produces the same trend.
